# Summary

Explain what you want us to develop for the Douglas College API

e.g. localization (English, Mandarin, etc.), webhooks support, a Python wrapper, etc.

## Use Cases

Why should we develop this or add it to the roadmap? Who will it benefit? How will they use it? What kind of app ideas can use this part of the API (e.g. a clubs API could help create a club management tool).

## Risks

Why should we not do this? Please consider:

- cost of implementation (think of time and our developer resources)
- cost to host this service (if this will exist as a separate service)
- cost to maintain
- potential security or legal risks we may face (e.g. we probably don't want to develop a "course auto register" service because that would involve authenticating ourselves on the Douglas College portal, a service we don't own)

## Implementation details

Please tell us your ideas on how to implement this. For example, we can have this either running on its own container/server, as its own cloud function, or as a module another part of the codebase uses.
